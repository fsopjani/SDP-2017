Strategy design pattern is a behavioural pattern, strategy pattern is an implementation of different specific algorithms
and choosing one to use while the application is running.

The strategy design pattern helps with encapsulation as each algorithm can be separately
defined and then injected into the classes that use it. The different implementations are
also interchangeable.

The abstract factory design pattern is creational design pattern, it is used to encapsulate a group of factories that
have some common logic in between.

The abstract factory design pattern is useful when we want to expose a set of encapsulated factory objects
e.g. database connectors. The clients become decoupled from the concrete classes.
